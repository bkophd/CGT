# CGT
This repository contains the raw data for the Computational Grounded Theory research project. Only Tweet IDs are shared, therefore, to reproduce the dataset, it is important to rehydrate the tweets. We recommend using TWARC (https://twarc-project.readthedocs.io/) utilities for this purpose.

The source code files are:
CGT_Clustering.ipynb (Jupyter notebook)
CGT_TopicModeling.ipynb  (Jupyter notebook) and
CGT_SBERT_Semantic.ipynb (Google Colab notebook)
